# sponsored-links
 
This list of 400+ sponsored links wat put together by Yann Guégan, French journalist based in Paris. They were scraped from a sample of 10 French online news outlets that partnered up with three different ad services (Outbrain, Taboola and Smartfeed), using a Python/Selenium script on August 14, 2019.

* *media.csv* contains the list of the websites, including the RSS feed used to get the stories where the ads were embedded.
* *impressions.csv* contains the list of the impressions that have been scraped. 
	* *code_imp* is an unique identifier for the impressions
	* *code_ad* is an unique identifier for the ad itself (the same ad can run on several websites)
